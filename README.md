# MyReads Project
This project was a Udacity nanodegree curriculum which i have have to use React Framework and build 
an Webapplication which sorts books in the right shelves.
the project have three different Shelves, Current Reading, Want To Read, and Reading

## Functionality 
the user can search a Bookin application and if the user founds it can move the Book one of the three shelves. 
also the user can select NONE and it will disappear from current shelf. but it will be still in th search Page.

the user can easily change shelfes.

 ### how to use
 at first users can clone the code from the github account, then in the Terminal you can write npm install after that 
 run the code by writing in Terminal npm start 
 it will start and start using Webapplication

 #### What i learned from the project
 this is my first React project in the Udacity, it was a challenging, i learned separating code and building different 
 components, by puting the components and passing Data through props was the difficult part, but at the end i understood how 
 props work.
 i also used new Hooks like useState and useEffect which make the project challenging, i also learned how Link and Routing work.
